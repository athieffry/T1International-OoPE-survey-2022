BUT the only way I'm able to keep Medicaid is to keep my income under $17k. I purposefully only work 20hrs/wk to do so. While I like my Medicaid approved Endo they are not an MD. They are an NP. I pay out of pocket for another private Endo who has more experience and is better able to me treat my issues like hypo seizures. Before I was able to figure out this loophole, I worked 40hr weeks, paid $185/month in insurance premiums, and had an 8k yearly deductible before and prescription copay was covered. For years I rationed insulin/food and wasn't able to access insulin pumps or CGMs due to price. I still fight really hard for myself continuously to advocate for what keeps me alive like CGMs/pumps and the insulins that work better with my T1D and body. This involves teaching myself how to fight Medicaid rejection of Endo PRESCRIBED medications through contesting INSURANCE overrides if needed prescriptions. I.e. insurance says I no longer need glucose test strips as I have a CGM that I need to calibrate and check when CGM readings feel off or I am sick or run out of the allotted amount of supplies. I would love to marry my partner but we've decided not to as I would lose Medicaid coverage and we wouldn't be able to afford medication and life saving care without it."

"Healthcare for all.

We have the availability, but why hide my medications and supplies behind a prescription? Insulins, syringes, and pen needles require prescriptions from doctors that I can't afford or trust.     College and education for doctor's should be affordable enough to allow them to lower their list prices for services. It would allow them to focus on education, good medical services, and the patents' health if they could be incentivized in a non-superficial way to become doctors.    Medical doctor - last I checked - are doctors...not business men who force visits on you when you just want to be Free and independent to make my own medical decisions. If I need a doctor, I'll find one. They don't need to hold my life hostage because I'm bad with bureaucracies and independent with my health (due to my good health being noticed by my endos regarding A1C and lab results).     Some of us starve - whether purposefully or against our will - because the inefficient, overly privatized healthcare system in the US does little to make the needed supplies accessibly and affordable to ALL Americans.     Give them a chance to be healthy BEFORE they get a job. Some of us have no support from people (I'm lucky enough to have that), but healthcare should be accessible to ALL to allow ALL American citizens the opportunity to participate in the market.    I wanna shop for guitars, not shop-and-gamble for-and-with privatized insurance companies. They had their chance, and they fail the ones that need the most help.     For further discussion with a Public Servant or Official, please email Brandon Lee Gumm at brandongumm1996@yahoo.com    Also, illnesses like Diabetes can affect anyone no matter what their ideology or belief system. And no matter those same demographics, we all deal with the constant calls and check-ins to paid workers...while we pay with lost work time, lots of sick leave usage, or any other way to find time to reach the bureaucrats."

I never asked for this disease, nor did I ever make myself have this disease. I have to work harder to pay for my expensive healthcare & the cost of co-payments alongside supplies. Is draining me.

I chose to purchase my CGM supplies at Costco rather than paying the higher price out of pocket.  Since I use Costco, I can not even submit for reimbursement on my ""Bronze"" plan.  My max out of pocket is $6850 so the bottom line for me in this economy is to lower the price over all and I have to gamble that I won't have a major medical event that uses the max out of pocket in addition to the 4,200.00 i pay for CGM supplies.      Why is Florida Blue using a company that adds $200/mo to the CGM supplies?"	"Their needs to be some oversight of the predatory contract practices between the insurance companies and the supply providers who have added 1 or 2 layers of profit makers between the manufacturers and the patients who need drugs and medical supplies.  The CGM is a necessary component of the automated pump which can adjust insulin delivery up or down based on patient's glucose trends.      Keeping a patient off of dialysis and out of the hospital due to complications of T1D would seem to be a priority.  Currently, our elected officials seem to be more interested in the campaign donations these companies put in their pockets or the future board positions they may land after they leave office."

We are blessed for this insurance. But this is not the reality for people with type1 diabetes in Costa Rica. I suffer mostly for the moms and the kids because they have to sacrifice their lifestyle and health because of the lack of possibilites to take care of their diabetes. Moms abandon their jobs because they have to go to school to check their kids glucose, put insulin, if a kid  has 250 or a hypo , moms prefer not to send them to school because they cannot have information about their kids glucose and prefer to watch them at home for those days. This makes the kids feel they have a very critical disease, but if they would have dexcom or freestyle at least the mom could have information to make insulin or food choices so the kid can have a normal life and not one feeling sick because of the hypos and hipers. My email is twaserstein@gmail.com if you would like to help all these kids, it could be done. I can help personally or the work could be done through a diabetes foundation."	"A flash monitoring sensor or a constant monitoring sensor is NOT a luxury for type 1 diabetes. It should be a right for all the insured.  This way, all type 1 kids can have a more normal life, and not be worried about their numbers all the time, and not miss school or be out of sports because of their diabetes.  There should be a nurse in each school with a kid with diabetes trained to administer: insulin, check glucose, and administer glucagon.  Glucagon should be given annually to all type 1 homes.  There should be better education for public hospital for nurses and doctors, and also more education to families to make insulin decisions."	Complete

We have a flex spending account we max out ($2500/yr) and it only covers half our medical expenses in the year.  Most goes toward supplies and medical appointments for our son with T1D.  There is extra monitoring appointments (eye exams, bone scans) he will have to do that Add to these expenses.

I also find myself rationing insulin because of not seeing my doctor as often as I should due to prices of those appointments.	"It feels like they don't care about my well-being.

We are a group of disabled people that have been completely forgotten by our government and the capitalists have completely taken over. It is a complete embarrassment that diabetes care in the USA runs the way that it does when in other nations these basic supplies are covered or substantially (95%) prorated so that life saving medications and supplies are not rationed or unaffordable. Due to this and other political issues currently impacting the USA, I am considering immigrating to another country. This is not a sustainable way to live. I have taken a full time and part time job in order to pay for the expenses to just keep myself alive let alone my other expenses for my life and family. I cannot even describe the insurmountable financial burden that diabetes is and has been to me as a young adult. Since I was in college more than 10 years ago, I have been working two jobs in order to afford to be alive and this is something I must continue to do in order to afford my own care."	Complete

It's genetic and we have no family history of diabetes. My son has zero symptoms. He does not have any symptoms of high or low blood sugars and is entirely dependent on his devices to manage him. My husband and I have decent jobs as well. I am a nurse and my husband is a dairy farmer. I am working 90 hours a week to pay for his supplies. And that is with insurance. Being an autoimmune disease- he also requires screening and management of other autoimmune disorders including his thyroid. The one aspect that is not often considered with diabetics is the emotional and mental health associated with it. Eating disorders and suicide rates in type 1 is insane and the lifespan of a type one in my sons condition is 25 years old. But we have to scrimp on mental health coverage because every additional dollar that comes in goes directly towards his care. And he is really quite healthy. He has never had to be hospitalized since his diagnosis. The only office visits he has are for his routine check ups. And ge seldom needs adjustments made to his orders. This is the cost of an appropriately managed diabetic. There is no way he will ever be able to work 90 hours a week and provide the care he needs for himself.	Complete

I hate it. It takes so much away from me.	"Type 1 Diabetes is an awful disease to live with. For one it's incredibly deadly. 1 week without insulin, and I die. Too much insulin, and I die. Who do you know lives a daily life with those kinds of stakes? I will fight this balance everyday for the rest of my life on top of astronomical monthly medical costs and a constant threat from our government to take the option of life and access to insulin away from me entirely. If I had the option to cut my own arm or leg off myself to cure my Diabetes, I would do it in a heartbeat to end this cycle. Just give me the saw blade. But our government seems to not care for those with Type1. You make it sound like we did this to ourselves as if we deserve this. We didn't. It's an Autoimmune Disease that can come for anyone at any time. We did nothing to inflict this on ourselves. But we are dying regardless, with no help from our fellow Americans. If I I was born with this disease in Canada, Britain, Norway, New Zealand, and so many other places, I would be living a much less fearful life with my disease. A fuller life. This is supposed to be the land of the free, but you have created a prison, and a Squid Game like maze for me to run through on a daily basis. This country has very much been a ""Pull yourself up by your boot straps"" type of mentality. And I have done that time and time again to prove myself to my country yet, my life is on the line at every turn. Why? You can pull yourself out of a lot of things, but not this disease. Not without help, or at least the courtesy of the government to not make this more difficult than it needs to be. And frankly, I'm one of the lucky ones, managing to find some kind of career that helps me get through this. But if life is still this incredibly impossible, in this country, living with this disease, even with my status as a middle class American, I can't even imagine how many American lives are essentially sentenced to death because you have turned your back on us. This has to stop. I'm a valuable member of my community, I work hard, I contribute, and this disease doesn't have to be a death sentence, or a life hollowing curse if you stop making it one."

Of all the 12+ companies on the exchange, only THREE of them cover Humalog at all - the three most expensive options. Of those three, the least expensive has a $6000 prescription deductible, a non-starter when it comes to insulin. The second-most expensive one - which I have - covers Humalog at a $30/month copay, but doesn't cover the test strips that go with my pump (Contour Next strips), so I have to pay out of pocket for that or use a different meter that doesn't sync with my Medtronic 670G. Despite the fact that it was the ONLY plan on the ENTIRE health insurance exchange that covers all the supplies I need, the most expensive option was just too expensive to justify.     It makes me FURIOUS that so many companies do not cover Humalog. I've taken it since I was diagnosed with diabetes 20 years ago, and it's CRAZY to me that companies have just decided that I shouldn't be able to have it because there's no generic option. All insulin are not created equal, and I can't just switch to a different kind of insulin without redoing ALL of my medical decisions."	"That the absurd costs of diabetes care are not just about insulin - it's also about all the supplies and DME that all you to get the insulin into your body, know how much to take, etc. Sure, we can lower the cost of insulin, but that only goes so far if I'm still paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket for test strips, pump supplies, etc. If they only campaign to change the pricing of insulin but don't include the ridiculous costs of the rest of the supplies, the problems will continue to go unsolved.

Hence the survey question SHOULD have included options of prices pre and post deductible satisfaction. Because that was not provided as an option, I attempted to provide an ""average"" cost for supplies."	Most important is to address the safe-harbor exemption to the Federal Antikickback law widely abused by PBM's leading to Rx list price inflation which harms both uninsured and those who ARE insured but have deductibles yet to satisfy.

He was diagnosed at age 23, in 2002. He did not have medical insurance at the time. After being unable to pay for the amount of insulin and diabetic supplies he needed for 7 years, being sued for medical bills and barred from his primary doctor, he got a foot ulcer. He tried to stay off his foot, but still had to work so we wouldn't get buried in bills. Eventually he couldn't work. We couldn't keep up with bills and my paycheck was garnished frequently. Once they garnished my bank account AND check at the same time. I took time off and cried in court so I could pay my bills. It took 2 years for him to be approved for disability and it was NOT back dated. We chose not to fight because we were drowning in bills. Once he qualified for Medicare, we signed up for an Advantage plan. It's slightly better than what we had before but that donut hole comes fast. I found out about the insulin assistance program on my own and we signed up 2 years ago, which has helped. But it was not discussed by any healthcare professional, even when I was flat out telling doctors, we probably aren't going to be able to pay you, don't order expensive wound dressing, we can't afford what he needs. I have no faith in the medical establishment even though I work in the medical field. Most recently he had his toes removed on his left foot. It's helped. Now we keep hearing about dialysis. They are preparing us for what's going to happen next. It all could have been avoided if he could have gotten the care he needed when he was diagnosed."
