BUT the only way I'm able to keep Medicaid is to keep my income under $17k. I purposefully only work 20hrs/wk to do so. While I like my Medicaid approved Endo they are not an MD. They are an NP. I pay out of pocket for another private Endo who has more experience and is better able to me treat my issues like hypo seizures. Before I was able to figure out this loophole, I worked 40hr weeks, paid $185/month in insurance premiums, and had an 8k yearly deductible before and prescription copay was covered. For years I rationed insulin/food and wasn't able to access insulin pumps or CGMs due to price. I still fight really hard for myself continuously to advocate for what keeps me alive like CGMs/pumps and the insulins that work better with my T1D and body. This involves teaching myself how to fight Medicaid rejection of Endo PRESCRIBED medications through contesting INSURANCE overrides if needed prescriptions. I.e. insurance says I no longer need glucose test strips as I have a CGM that I need to calibrate and check when CGM readings feel off or I am sick or run out of the allotted amount of supplies. I would love to marry my partner but we've decided not to as I would lose Medicaid coverage and we wouldn't be able to afford medication and life saving care without it. ",That insulin for profit is literally killing people and forcing them into lives of perpetual poverty. That I wanted so much more for my life but big pharma has made that impossible. ,2

College and education for doctor's should be affordable enough to allow them to lower their list prices for services. It would allow them to focus on education, good medical services, and the patents' health if they could be incentivized in a non-superficial way to become doctors.    Medical doctor - last I checked - are doctors...not business men who force visits on you when you just want to be Free and independent to make my own medical decisions. If I need a doctor, I'll find one. They don't need to hold my life hostage because I'm bad with bureaucracies and independent with my health (due to my good health being noticed by my endos regarding A1C and lab results).     Some of us starve - whether purposefully or against our will - because the inefficient, overly privatized healthcare system in the US does little to make the needed supplies accessibly and affordable to ALL Americans.     Give them a chance to be healthy BEFORE they get a job. Some of us have no support from people (I'm lucky enough to have that), but healthcare should be accessible to ALL to allow ALL American citizens the opportunity to participate in the market.    I wanna shop for guitars, not shop-and-gamble for-and-with privatized insurance companies. They had their chance, and they fail the ones that need the most help.     For further discussion with a Public Servant or Official, please email Brandon Lee Gumm at brandongumm1996@yahoo.com    Also, illnesses like Diabetes can affect anyone no matter what their ideology or belief system. And no matter those same demographics, we all deal with the constant calls and check-ins to paid workers...while we pay with lost work time, lots of sick leave usage, or any other way to find time to reach the bureaucrats.

I chose to purchase my CGM supplies at Costco rather than paying the higher price out of pocket.  Since I use Costco, I can not even submit for reimbursement on my ""Bronze"" plan.  My max out of pocket is $6850 so the bottom line for me in this economy is to lower the price over all and I have to gamble that I won't have a major medical event that uses the max out of pocket in addition to the 4,200.00 i pay for CGM supplies.      Why is Florida Blue using a company that adds $200/mo to the CGM supplies?  ","Their needs to be some oversight of the predatory contract practices between the insurance companies and the supply providers who have added 1 or 2 layers of profit makers between the manufacturers and the patients who need drugs and medical supplies.  The CGM is a necessary component of the automated pump which can adjust insulin delivery up or down based on patient's glucose trends.      Keeping a patient off of dialysis and out of the hospital due to complications of T1D would seem to be a priority.  Currently, our elected officials seem to be more interested in the campaign donations these companies put in their pockets or the future board positions they may land after they leave office.  ",2

Turns out the new coverage only covers costs in specific circumstances but I was out of insulin and out of options. I paid 600 with the help of family. This is only bc the pharmacist was willing to break up the prescription to help lower the cost. Otherwise I was looking at almost $3,000.   I am a person who has insurance and hopefully won't have to do this next time but I imagine that if I struggle with this as well as access to care others are probably having a tough time as well.   In college the insurance I had would reimburse 80% of the cost after I paid for the full thing. It has been a struggle to pay for insulin for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed in 2005 at age 11. I have rationed and run out more times than I can count because of the cost.

I hate it. It takes so much away from me.,"Type 1 Diabetes is an awful disease to live with. For one it's incredibly deadly. 1 week without insulin, and I die. Too much insulin, and I die. Who do you know lives a daily life with those kinds of stakes? I will fight this balance everyday for the rest of my life on top of astronomical monthly medical costs and a constant threat from our government to take the option of life and access to insulin away from me entirely. If I had the option to cut my own arm or leg off myself to cure my Diabetes, I would do it in a heartbeat to end this cycle. Just give me the saw blade. But our government seems to not care for those with Type1. You make it sound like we did this to ourselves as if we deserve this. We didn't. It's an Autoimmune Disease that can come for anyone at any time. We did nothing to inflict this on ourselves. But we are dying regardless, with no help from our fellow Americans. If I I was born with this disease in Canada, Britain, Norway, New Zealand, and so many other places, I would be living a much less fearful life with my disease. A fuller life. This is supposed to be the land of the free, but you have created a prison, and a Squid Game like maze for me to run through on a daily basis. This country has very much been a ""Pull yourself up by your boot straps"" type of mentality. And I have done that time and time again to prove myself to my country yet, my life is on the line at every turn. Why? You can pull yourself out of a lot of things, but not this disease. Not without help, or at least the courtesy of the government to not make this more difficult than it needs to be. And frankly, I'm one of the lucky ones, managing to find some kind of career that helps me get through this. But if life is still this incredibly impossible, in this country, living with this disease, even with my status as a middle class American, I can't even imagine how many American lives are essentially sentenced to death because you have turned your back on us. This has to stop. I'm a valuable member of my community, I work hard, I contribute, and this disease doesn't have to be a death sentence, or a life hollowing curse if you stop making it one. ",2

Of all the 12+ companies on the exchange, only THREE of them cover Humalog at all - the three most expensive options. Of those three, the least expensive has a $6000 prescription deductible, a non-starter when it comes to insulin. The second-most expensive one - which I have - covers Humalog at a $30/month copay, but doesn't cover the test strips that go with my pump (Contour Next strips), so I have to pay out of pocket for that or use a different meter that doesn't sync with my Medtronic 670G. Despite the fact that it was the ONLY plan on the ENTIRE health insurance exchange that covers all the supplies I need, the most expensive option was just too expensive to justify.     It makes me FURIOUS that so many companies do not cover Humalog. I've taken it since I was diagnosed with diabetes 20 years ago, and it's CRAZY to me that companies have just decided that I shouldn't be able to have it because there's no generic option. All insulin are not created equal, and I can't just switch to a different kind of insulin without redoing ALL of my medical decisions. ","That the absurd costs of diabetes care are not just about insulin - it's also about all the supplies and DME that all you to get the insulin into your body, know how much to take, etc. Sure, we can lower the cost of insulin, but that only goes so far if I'm still paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket for test strips, pump supplies, etc. If they only campaign to change the pricing of insulin but don't include the ridiculous costs of the rest of the supplies, the problems will continue to go unsolved.

I also need to find a new doctor and set everything up--it's all incredibly stressful and I don't know where to start.

And medical staff often aren't familiar with the issue so I take time and money to experiment with these and use online forums to learn what works for other people (tens of thousands of people who don't have medical or financial support to help them either).

Even if you have access to specialized medical professionals, they struggle to work with the whole body and can't see how different challenges may be connected. They don't get systemic support either. I once participated in a research study where the researcher (who had an MD-PhD) said that every Type 1 he has met is effectively their own doctor.

Hence the survey question SHOULD have included options of prices pre and post deductible satisfaction. Because that was not provided as an option, I attempted to provide an ""average"" cost for supplies.",Most important is to address the safe-harbor exemption to the Federal Antikickback law widely abused by PBM's leading to Rx list price inflation which harms both uninsured and those who ARE insured but have deductibles yet to satisfy.

He was diagnosed at age 23, in 2002. He did not have medical insurance at the time. After being unable to pay for the amount of insulin and diabetic supplies he needed for 7 years, being sued for medical bills and barred from his primary doctor, he got a foot ulcer. He tried to stay off his foot, but still had to work so we wouldn't get buried in bills. Eventually he couldn't work. We couldn't keep up with bills and my paycheck was garnished frequently. Once they garnished my bank account AND check at the same time. I took time off and cried in court so I could pay my bills. It took 2 years for him to be approved for disability and it was NOT back dated. We chose not to fight because we were drowning in bills. Once he qualified for Medicare, we signed up for an Advantage plan. It's slightly better than what we had before but that donut hole comes fast. I found out about the insulin assistance program on my own and we signed up 2 years ago, which has helped. But it was not discussed by any healthcare professional, even when I was flat out telling doctors, we probably aren't going to be able to pay you, don't order expensive wound dressing, we can't afford what he needs. I have no faith in the medical establishment even though I work in the medical field. Most recently he had his toes removed on his left foot. It's helped. Now we keep hearing about dialysis. They are preparing us for what's going to happen next. It all could have been avoided if he could have gotten the care he needed when he was diagnosed.",The ONLY way to improve outcomes and cost expenditures for Type 1 diabetics is to remove financial barriers to proper care in order to prevent complications. ,2

After that, I had work-based health insurance of varying levels at different jobs (a travel agency; the Joslin Diabetes clinic, Boston University, an FQHC in Colorado, and then the Colorado state Medicaid agency, and until the passage of the ACA, always felt constrained to a job because of the fear of being uninsured for any amount of time and then  being classed as having a pre-existing condition.
